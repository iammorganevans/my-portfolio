        <h4>As a designer with a background in the social sciences, I approach complex problems with a unique understanding of diverse human needs and thrive on solving them with creative solutions that resonate with the end user. Through my work, I commit to producing results that are not only functional, but authentic and meaningful.</h4>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Morgan, a UX and Web Designer. Beginning my educational career studying Sociology and Anthropology, I've since pivoted my knowledge of what makes humans, human, into how to create designs that are effective, accessible, and dare I say delightful.</p>
        <p>When I'm not solving user problems or troubleshooting my code, you can find me curled up with a good book, working on my writing, or trying out a new recipe. I make some mean dark chocolate chip sea salt cookies.</p>
